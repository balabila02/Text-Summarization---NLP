(IAFS-III) brought the leaders and representatives of all 54 countries of the dynamic African countries to New Delhi for first time in a landmark summit meeting that is set to upscale and transform the multi-faceted India-Africa partnership. This was by far the biggest gathering of African leaders on the Indian soil and showcased multiple dimensions of the India-Africa relationship that is pivoted around trade, training, technology, capacity building and development partnership. In a clear reaffirmation of their unstinting commitment to building lasting partnerships with India, 41 countries were represented at the level of heads of state/government.

The architecture of the India-Africa engagement is evolving, with the two sides relating at three levels, namely bilateral, Regional Economic Communities (RECs) and the African Union.

The IAFS-III brought out vividly an increasing convergence of interests, values and a burgeoning web of win-win partnership between the two growth poles of the world. Afro-optimism is for real, and is attested by latest trends, with more than thirty African countries becoming functioning democracies.And itâ€™s not just resource-rich countries that are doing well, but also those countries, which are driven by enterprise and innovation of their people.

The resurgence of Africa has coincided with the rise of India as a global player, investor and provider of developmental assistance. The two narratives are now getting intertwined: be it trade, technology, training or reform of global governance, the multi-faceted ties between India and Africa are blossoming and finding new areas of convergence. The third India-Africa Forum Summit has opened new avenues for upscaling the India-Africa partnership across the spectrum.
